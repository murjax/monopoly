##Release 2: Go, Go To Jail, Income Tax, Luxury Tax When a player lands on go, they receive $200. When a player passes go, they receive $200. Note they get the money at the time they land on or pass over go, not the next turn. The do not get any money for leaving go (e.g. during the first turn or if they landed on go the previous turn).
